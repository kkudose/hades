# Hades

An easy way to share [Pact of Punishment](https://hades.pages.dev/) and [Mirror of Night](https://hades.pages.dev/mirror) setups for the video game, [Hades](https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/hades), by [Supergiant Games](https://www.supergiantgames.com/).

The speedrunning community likes to use shorthand like "DC2" which is jibberish to anyone not used to it. This tool solves that kind of problem by having a UI that's closer to the in-game UI, as well as having easily accessible descriptions.

If you can get (or have) the in-game icons for the Pact or Mirror, please share! They weren't on the [wiki](https://hades.fandom.com/wiki/Hades_Wiki).

## But actually:

I just wanted an excuse to check out [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/). I also wanted to see whether [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) was any good (it's nice!). To run locally,

Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Then run:
```bash
npm run dev
```
